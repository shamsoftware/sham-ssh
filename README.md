# sham.software Mock SSH API

Mock SSH and SFTP testing library for running an SSH server in process. SFTP uses a local temporary directory

This library is still under development. Feel free to use, contribute but there could be changes to
the API until it reaches 1.0 status. Of course, we'll try to keep breaking changes to a minimum.
